# Getting started with this code

You will need: 
1. A React environment - this project used Create-React-App, but other options are coming to outclass it
2. An API key for ProPublica; you can request one here: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api

Once you have an API key, replace the {API-KEY-HERE} text at the top of the probulicaAPI module file.
